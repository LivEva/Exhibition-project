## Virtual Exhibition Project...

A short and clear description of your project. Mention the purpose and key features: 

This project is a platform where users can explore virtual exhibitions from combined collections of antiquities and fine art. This platform will serve researchers, students, and art enthusiasts, providing a searchable and interactive experience of the collections.

## Instructions on use:

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-name.git

   cd project-name

   ```sh
   npm install

## Create an env file

In this project we are using two different API's to gather museum information. Harvard and Victoria and Albert Museum.

However, for Harvard we need a unique key to use this api, to achieve this do the following...

Visit this link and fill the request form for your unique key

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfkmEBqH76HLMMiCC-GPPnhcvHC9aJS86E32dOd0Z8MpY2rvQ/viewform

You should then recieve an email containing this key.

Now in your repo create a file called .env and inside the file add the line:

API_KEY=your_api_key_here 

and replace 'your_api_key_here' with the api key you have been sent.

This securely stores this key.
