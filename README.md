## Welcome to the... Virtual Exhibition Project!


This is a web application I developed to serve as a platform where users can explore virtual exhibitions from combined collections of antiquities and fine art. This platform will serve researchers, students, and art enthusiasts, providing a searchable and interactive experience of the collections.

The preparation for this project was enjoyable, it was important for me to find well-built, extensive API's for my exhibition data. This took some trial and error with different options, as I was working with two seperate API's, it was essential to find compatible ones that were built similarly. 

My tech choices for this full-stack project are React for front-end and Express and Node for backend. Having some experience with this framework before I thought it was a powerful choice for allowing this project's capabilties. 

Another reason I felt particularly enthusiastic going into this project was the freedom to design and stylise. With the primary subject being art, I wanted to reflect this in aesthetic of the site. This was a lot of fun to experiment with once the core functionalites were working successfully.
